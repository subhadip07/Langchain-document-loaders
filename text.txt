When I think about the amount of food waste in our community, it really frustrates me. It feels like such a senseless problem, especially when so many people are struggling to access basic necessities. My vision is to create a mobile app that connects local restaurants with shelters and food banks, allowing them to donate surplus food in real-time.

Honestly, the biggest challenge I foresee is getting restaurants and shelters to adopt the app. People are often resistant to change, and I'm sure there will be technical hurdles to overcome. But I'm determined to make this work. I've already started researching similar initiatives and reaching out to potential partners. I believe that by demonstrating the app's efficiency and impact, we can convince people to give it a try.

I’m incredibly excited about the potential of this project. The idea of making a tangible difference in people's lives is incredibly motivating. Of course, I'm also nervous. What if I fail? What if no one uses the app? Those thoughts creep in sometimes. But then I remind myself that even if we can help just a few people, it will be worth it. I’ve always felt a pull to do something meaningful, and this feels like my chance. I am ready to put in the work, even when it gets difficult. I know there will be setbacks, but I am confident that I can find solutions. I am eager to learn from every step of the process. I feel a sense of responsibility to see this through.
