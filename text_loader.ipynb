      "When I think about the amount of food waste in our community, it really frustrates me.

But I'm determined to make this work. I've already started researching similar initiatives and reaching out to potential partners. I believe that by demonstrating the app's efficiency and impact, we can convince people to give it a try.\n",

What if no one uses the app? Those thoughts creep in sometimes. But then I remind myself that even if we can help just a few people, it will be worth it. I’ve always felt a pull to do something meaningful, and this feels like my chance. I am ready to put in the work, even when it gets difficult. I know there will be setbacks, but I am confident that I can find solutions. I am eager to learn from every step of the process. I feel a sense of responsibility to see this through.\n",
